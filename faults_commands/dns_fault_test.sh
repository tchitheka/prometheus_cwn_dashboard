# dns_fault_test.sh — DNS resolution fault-injection tool
#
# Generates a controlled burst of DNS queries against a deliberately
# non-existent domain, to exercise the "Name Resolution (DNS Health)"
# panel's node_dns_failure_ratio indicator under realistic client-side
# load. Can run directly on the local machine (e.g. the gateway itself)
# or be dispatched over SSH to run on a remote client station -- the
# same local/remote dispatch pattern already used by throughputtest.bash
# and memfill_test.sh elsewhere in this fault-injection tool set.
#
# USAGE
#   ./dns_fault_test.sh <minutes> [user@remote_host] [wrong_domain]
#
# ARGUMENTS
#   minutes           Required. How long to run the fault condition, in
#                      whole minutes.
#   user@remote_host   Optional. If given, the test runs on this remote
#                      host via SSH instead of locally. Omit to run
#                      locally on the current machine.
#   wrong_domain       Optional. A domain to query that must NOT exist.
#                      If omitted, a built-in default under the .invalid
#                      TLD is used -- RFC 2606 reserves .invalid
#                      specifically for addresses guaranteed to never
#                      resolve, so the default doesn't depend on nobody
#                      having accidentally registered a "real" domain
#                      that happened to look fake.
#
# EXAMPLES
#   ./dns_fault_test.sh 5
#       Run locally for 5 minutes against the built-in default domain.
#
#   ./dns_fault_test.sh 5 takondwa@192.168.1.50
#       Run for 5 minutes on the remote station via SSH.
#
#   ./dns_fault_test.sh 5 takondwa@192.168.1.50 my-broken-test.example
#       Run remotely, querying a specific non-existent domain instead.
#
# DESIGN NOTES
#   - Every query uses a fresh, randomised subdomain rather than
#     repeatedly querying the exact same name. Most resolvers apply
#     RFC 2308 negative caching to NXDOMAIN responses; without this,
#     repeat queries for one fixed non-existent name would increasingly
#     be served straight out of cache rather than genuinely round-
#     tripping to the upstream resolver, understating the fault
#     condition instead of exercising it realistically.
#   - Remote execution blocks until the test completes, rather than
#     backgrounding and returning immediately (unlike flap_test.sh,
#     which specifically has to background because it toggles the very
#     interface the SSH control connection itself depends on). This
#     script never touches the network interface, so blocking is safe,
#     and it means the caller's terminal reports completion at the
#     right time either way, local or remote.
#   - The script pipes its own source over SSH and re-invokes itself
#     with an internal flag on the far end, rather than duplicating the
#     query-loop logic inside a separate heredoc. One implementation,
#     used both locally and remotely, so there is nothing to keep in
#     sync between two copies of the same logic.
